# Steam Recommendation Scraper

- Version 0.0.1

Small application to scrape recommendations made by a curator on Steam.


# Getting Started

Download the packaged executable that is appropriate for your system.

> Windows Defender will most likely complain. You will have to restore the file. Even after that is done, Windows Defender will attempt to dissuade you from running the executable and you will need to choose to "Run Anyway".

Run the executable and follow the instructions found on the GUI.

Successful scraping creates a CSV file in the same directory as the executable. Failure creates an 'error.txt' file.
